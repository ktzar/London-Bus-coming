To "install":

Create a symlink somewhere in your $PATH:

# ln -s /path/coming_bus.php /usr/bin/bus

and now you can 

$ bus -b 136 -s 73346

using the stop and bus you want.

You can even store your favourite bus and stop in ~/.bus

usage: 
bus [-s stop_number] [-b bus1[:bus2]]

~/.bus JSON format: 
{"buses":[123],"stop":12345}
